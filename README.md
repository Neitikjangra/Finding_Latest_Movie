🎬 Simple Movie Picker App : 

“Can’t decide what to watch? Let this app do the picking.”

💡 About the Project :

This is a small and fun movie picker app that helps you choose what to watch when you just can’t decide.
You simply tell it what genre you’re in the mood for — action, comedy, horror, sci-fi, or anything else — and it instantly gives you one movie suggestion with a short, catchy description.

It’s made to be simple, clean, and human — not overloaded with fancy stuff.

✨ Features :

🎭 Asks for your favorite genre
🎥 Suggests one random movie based on that
💬 Gives a short and eye-catching movie description
⚡ Works instantly — no API keys, no waiting
👶 Easy to understand and perfect for beginners

🧠 How It Works :

1. The app asks you to type a genre (like “action” or “comedy”).
2. It randomly picks one movie from a small list.
3. Then it shows you the movie’s title and a short, cool description.
4. That’s it — one question, one answer, no overthinking your movie night.

🖥️ Example Output : 
🎬 What genre would you like to watch? > Sci-fi

Your Pick 🎯: Interstellar
🔥 Description: A breathtaking journey through space and time to save what’s left of humanity.
