🎬 Simple Movie Picker App : 

“Can’t decide what to watch? Let this app do the picking.”

💡 About the Project

This is a small and fun movie picker app that helps you choose what to watch when you just can’t decide.
You simply tell it what genre you’re in the mood for — action, comedy, horror, sci-fi, or anything else — and it instantly gives you one movie suggestion with a short, catchy description.

It’s made to be simple, clean, and human — not overloaded with fancy stuff.

🧠 How It Works

The app asks you to type a genre (like “action” or “comedy”).

It randomly picks one movie from a small list.

Then it shows you the movie’s title and a short, cool description.

That’s it — one question, one answer, no overthinking your movie night.
